# CORnet analysis

Examine usefulness of representations for classification, through development and across layers of network.
Will be used to expand Anna Birbeck's project relating AoA and layer in network

Examination of development of CORnet-S representations
Loads a checkpoint that is the result of training
Freezes weights in convolutional network
Adds a logistic regression to each layer

Based on code from  DeepCluster from Facebook Research https://github.com/facebookresearch/deepcluster
and CORnet from Dicarlo lab at MIT https://github.com/dicarlolab/CORnet
